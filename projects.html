        <h2>Technical Experience</h2>
        <div class="experience">
            <h3>Experience 1: Lumina Instruments / Onto Innovation </h3>
            <p>At Lumina/Onto, I work remotely to enhance product's software by implementing improvements and adding new features using C#. My role focuses on refining and optimizing the software to meet evolving needs.

               During the summer, I collaborated with engineers to test electronic circuit boards and power supply modules. After the testing phase, I contributed to updating and revising test procedures to improve accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, I configured computer systems by installing hardware components and software applications to support testing operations.</p>

        <div class="experience">
            <h3>Experience 2: Cepheid </h3>
            <p>  At Cepheid I was tasked with two projects during my internship. The first project involved collaborating with the firmware verification team to perform several tests on a company product. These tests consisted of functional tests, with optical and thermal calibration. 
                 The second project involved validating the manufacturing software, ensuring alignment between the test protocol and the software to prevent any gaps in functionality. </p>

            <h3>Community Project 1: SVEF College Mentor </h3>
            <p>Silicon Valley Education Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving STEM education in the Silicon Valley region, specifically hoping to provide underserved students with an equal opportunity for success. My role took place in the classroom teaching these students math, and getting them ready for college.</p>
