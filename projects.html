        <div class="experience">
            <h3>Experience 1: Lumina Instruments / Onto Innovation </h3>
            <p>Here at Lumina/Onto I currently work remotely to improve upon their software. Using C# I make any adjustments or add on any features they would like onto their software for circuit board testing. During the summer I collaborated with several engineers and assisted in the testing of electronic circuit boards and power supply modules.
                Afterward, I would contribute to updating and revising various test procedures. Additionally, configuring computer systems,
                including installation of hardware components and software applications..</p>

        <div class="experience">
            <h3>Experience 2: Cepheid </h3>
            <p>  At Cepheid I was tasked with two projects during my internship. The first project involved collaborating with the firmware verification team to perform several tests on a company product. These tests consisted of functional tests, with optical and thermal calibration. 
                 The second project was validating the manufacturing software. I would ensure no gap between the test protocol and the software. </p>
